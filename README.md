# Main objective

    The main objectives of this project are to develop a web-based application and an android app to help in manage and guide road repair managers to complete the 
    projects in a timely manner effectively and efficiently.


# Individual Objectives,

    Objective of the data collection module is to identify areas needed to be repaired on the particular road which has distressed and feed that data into rest of the system.
    
        Collect data and process them and identify the job areas using tools and generate useful and clear data using image processing algorithms.
        Develop the system to take multiple input sources.
        Develop an app/platform for community to feed the data about local distresses 
        final processing and UI implementation for generate unified and more accurate understandable data and suggestions for users.

	    The objective of this labor estimation for road maintenance module is to estimate the required labor to repair particular set of identified road distresses. 
	    Furthermore, the labor 	estimations from this module will be useful in estimating the overall cost of the project in the Costing module.
	    Therefore, the decision makers of the project will be well equipped with data to make accurate decisions.

	    Ascertainment of cost, assisting management in decision making and Cost control are some of the Specific Objectives of the Overall Costing Module as this module 
	    is proposed to give accurate details to the user more effectively and efficiently which makes life much easier.
        
        Estimate the cost of repair in particular area using cost estimation algorithm.
        Develop methods and materials to user training and easy understanding
        final processing and UI implementation for generate unified and more accurate understandable data and suggestions for users about cost and possible alternatives.

        Estimate the materials needed for the identified damaged area/road.

	    Objective of the material estimation module is to estimate the material needed for repair the particular road which has identified distresses. This module will use 
	    for cost estimation as well as labor estimation. Therefore, the SRMMS would be very important to make more accurate decisions and reduce human errors to those who are
	    using this system.

# Main Research questions

    The study attempts to address the Research questions which was brought up by the managers at Ministry of Public Administration and Management such as
    “Will the proposed new system save time?”,
    “Can we reduce the cost which is currently used in our manual system?”, 
    “Will it be more accurate?”, 
    “Can we detect the surrounding other than the roads?” and “Can we reduce the labor force which is currently used?”

   To this end, this proposed study will address all the mentioned issues using Information Technology along with the help by Civil Engineers at RDA (Road Development Authority)
   more specifically “IOT (Internet of things)” and machine learning with the intelligence gathered through the research that is available to mitigate the mentioned currently 
   faced problems.

# Individual research question

        Identify the methods of data gathering and find optimal way to extract accurate data as possible, identify the objects using detection techniques and output that
        extracted data to 	other component to process

        The objective of this labour estimation for road maintenance module is to estimate the required labour to repair particular set of identified road distresses. 
        Furthermore the labour estimations from this module will be useful in estimating the overall cost of the project in the Costing module. Therefore the decision makers of the project will be well equipped with data to make accurate decisions. 

    	Accurate labor estimation is one of the most important components in road maintenance. In Sri Lankan context, the method utilized at the present by the Road Development 
    	Authority is 	to gather data using physical surveys. Then to categorize the distresses based on the material used to build the road surface, depth of the pothole etc.
    	Taking in to account the 	above categorizations, RDA estimates the required labor based on the guidelines given in Highway Schedule of Rates document.

    	Mainly focuses on giving answers for the manual system so the time taken for detecting estimation will be reduced (make the system efficient)

    	Proposed system will cover up the problems which is in the manual system, with providing high level accuracy data using Advanced Information Technology so that the
    	wastage of time 	will be reduced, Labor force can be reduced as well can bring in a plan to manage cost in a more desirable way

        Estimate the material needed for the particular damaged area.
            After the identification of the particular damaged area/road, the system would estimate the material needed for the repair.
            Create the database using mySQL using HSR document and access it to estimate more accurate materials quantity for the repair, than human jugdement.
            Categorize materials.
            Finalize the project with implementing UI for the user to easily access the system with reduced waste of time.

    	In Sri Lanka, currently and ongoing, government collect the data about maintainable roads by using surveys on 6 months of period [2]. When collecting data, 
    	those particular data 		could be wrong or inaccurate. Because, only the humans and humans by themselves are completing those surveys and other questionnaires.
    	After, the collected data would be analyzed 		manually, and then a team would be sent to the particular location to check the corresponding distresses on the road 
    	which are collected by the data given from the villagers and/or 		citizens. Then the team take discussions about the particular distresses and analyze the problem 
    	themselves manually, so the analytics could be also wrong as human common errors.

# Other necessary information

	•	Python language will be used to develop the system.
	•	Firebase will be used for to maintain the Database.
	•	Mat lab will be used to demonstrate algorithms.


   *vehicle mounted sensor will be used in our project to gather data and it will be purchased by the Ministry of public Administration and Management according to our request which will be an asset to the country.
